    <h3>Ahh, I bet you had no idea all of your co-workers are watching you right now.</h3>
    <p>This is what happens when you forget to end the call, and when you forget to turn off your camera.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of forgetfulness.</li>
        <li>7 ounces of shame.</li>
        <li>A handful of newfound trauma.</li>
        <li>173 new job applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start conference call with coworkers.</li>
        <li>Realize no one wants to be on the call, proceed anyways.</li>
        <li>Pontificate.</li>
        <li>Time to end the call: pour in the 4 cups of forgetfulness.</li>
        <li>Start getting ready to take a shower.</li>
        <li>Hear notification sound, check computer; stir in the 7 ounces of shame.</li>
        <li>After coming to terms with having stripped for your entire office, add in a dash of that newfound trauma.</li>
        <li>Start filling out new job applications. 173 new applications, actually.</li>
        <li>Vow never to use Zoom again.</li>
    </ol>
