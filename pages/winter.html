  <h1 id="header">Why are you invading Russia in the winter?</h1>
  <img class="too_wide" src="../images/General_Winter.jpg" alt="Poster of Russia's 'General Winter' rising from underneath the snow.">

  <h3>It's been tried. Many times, actually.</h3>
  <p>So many times there's an entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Winter">wikipedia entry</a> dedicated to this very to topic.</p>
 
  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>10 ounces of hubris.</li>
    <li>20 ounces of ignorance.</li>
    <li>A sprinkle of idiocy.</li>
    <li>A boatload of frostbite.</li>
    <li>Many, many frozen tears.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Forget about the countless times this has been tried before. To do so, combine the 10 ounces of hubris with the 20 ounces of ignorance.</li>
    <li>Using the sprinkle of idiocy, disregard the many advisors begging you to rethink your decision.</li>
    <li>Blaze onwards, with reckless abandon. At the end of the day, it's not you out on the battlefield.</li>
    <li>This is where the final two ingredients get introduced: frostbite and tears. Stir thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Once all mixed together, collapse onto your knees in the recognition that you have successfully completed a recipe for disaster.
      <ul>
        <li>Success, in this scenario, actually means failure: you've successfully failed to invade Russia during the winter. Well done.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You can now rest easy at night, knowing your name will be added to the aformentioned wikipedia entry. Sleep well, sweet prince.</li>
  </ol>
